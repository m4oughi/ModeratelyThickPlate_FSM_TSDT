# Buckling analysis of moderately Thick Plate using Finite Strip Method based on Third-order Shear Deformation Theory

This repository is dedicated to a little part of my master’s thesis. The focus of this code is on understanding how the mechanical buckling of a moderately thick plate behaves. The analysis is conducted using the Finite Strip Method (FSM) based on Third-order shear deformation theory. I used a Python package called Sympy to develop the formulation and get accurate matrix computations. You can verify this code with the research presented by Gagnon et al. [1]. <br><br>
Feel free to explore the repository, and if you have any questions or want to chat about this, I’m all ears! <br><br>
