# Buckling analysis of moderately Thick Plate using Finite Strip Method based on Third-order Shear Deformation Theory

This repository is dedicated to a little part of my master’s thesis. The focus of this code is on understanding how the mechanical buckling of a moderately thick plate behaves. The analysis is conducted using the Finite Strip Method (FSM) based on Third-order shear deformation theory. I used a Python package called Sympy to develop the formulation and get accurate matrix computations. Feel free to explore the repository, and if you have any questions or want to chat about this, I’m all ears!
